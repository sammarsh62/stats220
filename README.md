# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Mathematics, Physics, and Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am a novelist who made odd life choices and ended up in a stats degree taking this intriguing required course instead of writing ones...*somehow*
- I am interested in learning about .... an **inordinately** high quantity of things, yes, including coding, data and probability
